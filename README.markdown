# BSLCKS
A django project customized for use at Beautiful Savior Lutheran Church in Olathe, KS (http://bslcks.org)

## TODO:
 Mostly in order

### Functionality
 * Site Search
 * Date-based navigation for news in left block
 * Liturgi-Cal (church year detection and banner for homepage)
 * api keys tag for the base template (allow jquery on non-core apps templates)
 * Pretty comment form
 * Outline dependancies in the app (low priority)
 * Flickr

### System
 * Code cleanup (badly needed)
 * Code documentation

### Templates / UI
 * Template refactoring to make sub-pages less breakable (ie the Bigblock "Worship with us" div that's on most pages is duplicated rather than inherited)
 * CSS and Templates need to be less functionality specific and more generalized (ie, devotional classes need to go away and be replaced with more generic layout hints)
